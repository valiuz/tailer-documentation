# Introduction

## 🗺 Overview

In this example, we want to process and analyze data from a fictional retailer called "Iowa Liquor". These data are organized in CSV files named according to a specific pattern including a timestamp, and are streamed at regular intervals into a Google Cloud Storage bucket. We'll first transfer them to a bucket located in a different Google Cloud project, load the data into a BigQuery table, and then prepare the data in order to analyze them with an AI model.

##  👨🎓 What you'll learn

* How data flows through a Tailer Platform data pipeline
* Creating JSON configuration files for data operations
* Deploying data operations with Tailer SDK
* Checking information in Tailer Studio

##  🛠 What you'll need

* Tailer SDK installed on your local machine \(see [Prepare your local environment for Tailer](../getting-started/prepare-your-local-environment-for-tailer.md) and [Install Tailer SDK](../getting-started/install-tailer-sdk.md)\)
* GCP configured for use with Tailer SDK \(see [Set up Google Cloud Platform](../getting-started/set-up-google-cloud-platform.md)\) and credentials required to transfer files safely \(see [Encrypt your credentials](../getting-started/encrypt-your-credentials.md)\)
* Access to two projects in GCP on which you have the appropriate permissions
* A terminal to run commands
* CSV files to process \(provided at next step\)
